# Shift-Web-App
The following project is a web app made using CSS and HTML using Google Maps API. This was made for my company called Shift which I co-founded as part of the Zero-to-Startup program. The webapp allows users to check their rewards, their stats in terms of graphs and directions from one place to another.
